          <p class="heading"> Founder's Note</p>
          <h2 class="note">Bachpan-Save The Innocence was founded in January 2020 with a vision to create a  world of hope where children will know about their rights and raise their voice against sexual assault,
            whenever required. Child sexual assault is a major problem that secretly hides in our family and society and still, we are unaware of it.
            There are innumerable reasons that make a child vulnerable to sexual abuse and we are working to eliminate those reasons.
            <br><br>
            We are on a mission to aware and empower children to stand their voice against sexual assault with the power of education and empowerment.
            We believe that if children are imparted proper education of safe and unsafe touch, Sexual Consent and, Cybersafety, they will be more alert and careful.
            However, children are not the only stakeholders we have, we also aware teachers and parents through parenting sessions by providing them with the knowledge of child rights.
            <br><br>
            Our mission not only includes children from getting victimized but it also aims to prevent them from victimizing others.
            <br><br>
            I thank every member of Bachpan family for their passion and determination towards the mission.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely <br><br>
